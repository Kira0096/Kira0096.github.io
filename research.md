###### Artificial Intelligence in Simulation-based Training
---
**_Goal_**:  
To provide feedback to trainees in virtual training environments to support skill learning and decision making.   
  
<small>Virtual reality (VR) based training is a modern training methodology that involves practice and learning in simulated (as opposed to physical) environments such as VR surgery/flight/driving simulators. Providing real-time tutoring feedback in such an environment is a challenging task. In this project, we explore and apply supervised data mining techniques to generate real-time feedback from available expert/novice behavioural samples, and validate these techniques in a VR surgical environment.  </small>
