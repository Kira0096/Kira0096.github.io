I am a 3rd year Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/">James Bailey</a> and Dr. <a href="http://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person543793">SudanthiÂ Wijewickrema</a> (Medical School, University of Melbourne).

Prior to my Ph.D, I received my Master degree in Engineering from Tsinghua Univeristy (China, 2015), and my Bachelor degree in Engineering from Jilin University (China, 2010).

I work in areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and adversarial learning (AL), and my recent works focus on theoretical aspects of adversarial learning and AI in virtual reality based surgical training.
