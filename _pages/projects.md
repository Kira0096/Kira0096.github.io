### Adversarial Machine Learning

* Exploring the vulnerability of machine learning mdoels to adverarial attacks under both black-box and white-box settings. 

* Defense machine learning models against adversarial attacks.

* Improving dversarial training as a defense technique for model robustness.

* Model interpretation and understanding.

* Image, video, text, audio adversarial examples.

* From Lp-bounded to unrestricted adversarial perturbations.

### Robust Supervised/Weakly-Supervised Learning
