I am currently a research fellow at the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, working on a data mining project with [Prof. James Bailey](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/).

I am a passionate researcher in the area of machine learning and deep learning, and interested in topics like adversarial attack/defense, deep noisy label learning, generative adversarial networks, information and intrinsic dimensionality, and differential privacy and security. I am also intrigued by the connection between the universe, gravity, the Big Bang theory and space of deep neural networks.

I received my PhD degree from University of Melbourne (Australia), under the supervision of [Prof. r James Bailey](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/) and [Dr. SudanthiÂ Wijewickrema](http://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person543793). Prior to my PhD, I received my master degree from Tsinghua University (China) and bachelor degree from Jilin University (China).
