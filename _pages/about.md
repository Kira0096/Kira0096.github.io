I am currently a research fellow @ School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, working with <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">Prof. James Bailey</a>. I received my PhD degree from The University of Melbourne (2018), supervised by <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">Prof. James Bailey</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MjgOHPYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. SudanthiÂ Wijewickrema</a>. Before that, I obtained my MSE/B.E. degrees from Tsinghua/Jilin University, China.

I am a passionate researcher with particular interests in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision topics: adversarial attack/defense, noisy label learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs). And have collabarated with <a href="http://research.nii.ac.jp/~meh/" target="_blank">Prof. Michael E. Houle</a> (NII, Japan), <a href="http://www.crystal-boli.com/" target="_blank">A/Prof. Bo Li</a> (UIUC), <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ywang3430/" target="_blank">Dr. Yisen Wang</a> (Tsinghua University) and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" target="_blank">Prof. Dawn Song</a> (UC, Berkeley).
