I am a research fellow at the School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, where also I obtained my PhD in 2019. I work closely with <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">Prof. James Bailey</a>. Prior to my PhD, I recieved my M.Eng. and B.Eng. degrees from Tsinghua University and Jilin University successively.

### Research Interests:
* Machine Learning
 * Adversarial machine learning
 * Model interpretation
 * Weakly supervised learning

* Deep Learning
 * Adversarial attack/defense
 * Generative adverarial networks
 * Computer vision

I am a passionate researcher with broad interests in machine learning, deep learning, their theory and applications. I am also very lucky to have wonderful collabarations with many highly respected researchers and professors, including <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/baileyj/" target="_blank">Prof. James Bailey</a> (UniMelb), <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" target="_blank">Prof. Dawn Song</a> (UC, Berkeley), <a href="http://research.nii.ac.jp/~meh/" target="_blank">Prof. Michael E. Houle</a> (NII, Japan), <a href="http://www.crystal-boli.com/" target="_blank">A/Prof. Bo Li</a> (UIUC), <a href="https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/" target="_blank">A/Prof. Sarah Erfani</a> (UniMelb), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MjgOHPYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. SudanthiÂ Wijewickrema</a> (UniMelb), and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csyisenwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Yisen Wang</a> (Tsinghua University).
