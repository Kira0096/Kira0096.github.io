1. Exploring the vulnerability of machine learning mdoels to adverarial attacks under both black-box and white-box settings. 

2. Defense machine learning models against adversarial attacks.

3. Improving dversarial training as a defense technique for model robustness.

4. Model interpretation and understanding.

5. Image, video, text, audio adversarial examples.

6. From Lp-bounded to unrestricted adversarial perturbations.
